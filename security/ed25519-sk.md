# SSH Key type `ed25519-sk` (and `ecdsa-sk`)

Today I noticed by coincidence that (recent versions of;
e.g. the one available on Fedora Silverblue 34) `ssh-keygen`
have `ed25519-sk` (and `ecdsa-sk`) key types (`-t`).

Never having seen these before, I wondered what they were for...

It is explained e.g. on https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/240991/what-is-the-sk-ending-for-ssh-key-types, and in the chapter "FIDO/U2F Support" on https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2.

This is very nice, as it much simplifies the [much too complicated old ways of using `gpg-agent` to SSH with a YubiKey](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide#ssh).

I tried generating such a new type of SSH key with my YubiKey. At first it failed:

    $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk
    Generating public/private ed25519-sk key pair.
    You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
    Key enrollment failed: requested feature not supported

This is apparently because the Firmware on the particular YubiKey I had tested this with was too old. But using the other key type worked, even less secure and ideally recommended (if you have a newer YubiKey):

    $ ssh-keygen -t ecdsa-sk
    Generating public/private ecdsa-sk key pair.
    You may need to touch your authenticator to authorize key generation.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/var/home/vorburger/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk): 
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
    Enter same passphrase again: 
    Your identification has been saved in /var/home/vorburger/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk
    Your public key has been saved in /var/home/vorburger/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub
    The key fingerprint is: SHA256:nwf4+ba...VM vorburger@silverblue
    The key's randomart image is:
    +-[ECDSA-SK 256]--+
    (...)
    +----[SHA256]-----+

Copying the generated `.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub` (which starts with `sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com`) 
to another a machine let me SSH to it, with the usual touch operation on the YubiKey to confirm.

The `ecdsa-sk` have only 192 Key Length, which according e.g. [this](https://justcryptography.com/key-length/) or [this](https://www.keylength.com/en/4/) is too short, also [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/SSH_keys#ECDSA) recommends against _ecdsa_ in general.

These keys also work on GitHub! (Since May 2021, see [yubico's announcement](https://www.yubico.com/blog/github-now-supports-ssh-security-keys/), [GitHub's blog](https://github.blog/2021-05-10-security-keys-supported-ssh-git-operations/), [GitHub's doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key-for-a-hardware-security-key).)

On ChromeOS this [unfortunately does not work yet](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1030778).
