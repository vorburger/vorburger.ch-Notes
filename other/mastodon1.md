# Mastodon, Nov. 2022

Elon Musk is a succesful disruptor.

For example, he (together with Peter Thiel) disrupted online payments with Paypal.

He also thinks he is disrupting the future of cars; although of course his Teslas
have Vehicle Autonomy Level 2 only; whereas (Google's) [Waymo](https://waymo.com)
is the real deal - Level 5. (I had the opportunity to actually sit in one in SFO.
It's... incredible!)

Today Elon Musk managed to disrupt... ME - into finally [joining Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)!

[Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) seems pretty neat.
It's technically of course only [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse),
and not actually truly [decentralized](https://github.com/vorburger/awesome-decentralized-internet-web3-blockchain-p2p-security-world-cloud#social-networks--media), but a lot of folks still don't really understand the difference.
That's just fine! Let's first move from tody to _federated_, and then eventually to fully _decentralized,_
that will work great.

The supposed _"initial pain that you have to decide which of the many Mastodon
server instances you actually sign up for"_ seems a little overrated, to me.
I mean, you probably went from using your ISP's email domain, then your university's,
then Hotmail, then Gmail - so surely you can choose your next social network as well?

Personally, I was initially about to join https://floss.social (hey [@downey](https://floss.social/@downey)),
or https://fosstodon.org, which would make sense for someone with my personal background and interest
in open source - but YMMV, of course.

Then I stumbled upon https://tooting.ch. I think the dude who runs it must probably live
somewhere right around the corner from my place! That seemed neat, and fitting for this
particular disruption... [_"Think globally, act locally?"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_globally,_act_locally)

So long, Twitter.  See you on Mastodon! I look forward to re-connecting with you as https://tooting.ch/@vorburger.
