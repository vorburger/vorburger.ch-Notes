# Mastodon, Nov. 2022

Elon Musk is a succesful disruptor.

For example, he (together with Peter Thiel) disrupted online payments with Paypal.

He also thinks he is disrupting the future of cars; although of course his Teslas
have Vehicle Autonomy Level 2, only; whereas (Google's) [Waymo](https://waymo.com)
is the real deal - Level 5. (I had the opportunity to actually sit in one in SFO.
It's... incredible!)

Today Elon Musk managed to disrupt... ME - into finally [joining Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)!

[Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) seems pretty neat.
It's technically of course only [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse),
and not actually truly [decentralized](https://github.com/vorburger/awesome-decentralized-internet-web3-blockchain-p2p-security-world-cloud#social-networks--media), but a lot of folks still don't really understand the difference.
That's just fine! (Let's first move from today to _federated_, and then eventually to fully _decentralized,_
that will work great.)

The supposed _"initial pain that you have to decide which of the many Mastodon
server instances you actually sign up for"_ seems a little overrated, to me.
I mean, you probably went from using your ISP's email domain, then your university's,
then Hotmail, then Gmail - so surely you can choose your next social network as well?

Personally, I was initially about to join https://floss.social (hey [@downey](https://floss.social/@downey)),
or https://fosstodon.org, which would make sense for someone with my personal background and interest
in open source - but YMMV, of course.

Then I stumbled upon https://tooting.ch. I think the dude who runs it must probably live
somewhere right around the corner from my place! That seemed neat, and fitting for this
particular disruption... [_"Think globally, act locally?"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_globally,_act_locally)

So long, Twitter.  See you folks on Mastodon! I look forward to re-connecting with you as https://tooting.ch/@vorburger.

PS: It could perhaps also be fun to run my own Maston instance, one day. But I would probably
opt to make it cost $1/month per user, or something like that.  Volunary donations are a neat idea,
but in practice don't really work. People just don't pay for stuff that they can have for free,
it's (apparently) basic human psychology 101. And nothing is really "free", of
course; you pay somehow, either with your data, or someone else's volunteer time (which
just doesn't scale, unfortunately; at least not until we have Star Trek economics).  And I would
also consider requiring some sort of identity verification, known at least to the operator, if not
even fully publicly; not because George Orwell was right (he was, of course), but just because I
still don't really understand what makes anyone think that the Internet should be a place where
idiots can shout at each other hiding behind anonymity. If you wouldn't do/say it in say... a
public transport, you can't do it online. Is it really (much?) more complicated than that?
