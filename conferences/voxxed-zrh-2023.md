# Voxxed Days Z√ºrich 2023-03-16

Today I attended [Voxxed Days Z√ºrich](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/).

Voxxed Days are a series of technical conferences for developers, affiliated with the legendary https://devoxx.com.

Future events include the Voxxed Days in Ticino on 2024-01-19 and next year's in ZRH on 2024-03-07.

It is locally organized, with 25% of [speakers](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/schedule/speakers/) from Switzerland (and 22% female speakers, great!), and sponsored by Swiss IT companies such as Swisscom, Gradle Enterprise (!), ELCA, Julius B√§r, Red Hat, Ergon, Adesso, Mimacom, CSS.

Glancing at [#VDZ23 ü¶£ Toots](https://fosstodon.org/tags/VDZ23) and [#VDZ23 üê¶ Tweets](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VDZ23&src=typed_query) gives you good quick impression about the event.

[All sessions](https://voxxeddays.com/zurich/schedule/) were recorded and will eventually be published on YouTube, just like [the 2022 edition's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRsbF2sD7JVpqMrdjuw0yDAHx-LWkeJHN) were.

Some of the sessions I was listening in to were:

  * Yep.

As I get older, the content of many talks doesn't exactly throw me of my chair anymore.

What really makes attending tech conferences worth your time are hallway conversations.

I had great chats between the sessions with 2 old friends of mine about https://enola.dev!
